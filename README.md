# liquidCNA_data
Copy number tables generated to evaluate the accuracy of liquidCNA, a method for tracking emergent subclone dynamics in CNA data from longitudinal biopsies. The tables contain raw and segmented copy number information (generated using QDNAseq) from in vitro mixtures of two high-grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines.

For further details on the method, see [liquidCNA's github page](https://github.com/elakatos/liquidCNA).
