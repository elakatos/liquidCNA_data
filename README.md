# liquidCNA_data
This page contains:

(1) The copy number tables from in vitro cell line mixtures, generated to evaluate the accuracy of liquidCNA, a method for tracking emergent subclone dynamics in CNA data from longitudinal biopsies. The tables hold raw and segmented copy number information (generated using QDNAseq) from the two high-grade serous ovarian cancer cell lines (B0, B1), from healthy blood (N0) and 6 mixtures samples (S0-S5).

(2) The list of putatively therapy-associated (subclone-associated) COSMIC genes in cfDNA samples of patients undergoing therapy. The tables of each patient contain the copy number of each gene in baseline and post-baseline samples, together with the direction of the associated post-baseline SCNA identified by Chen and colleagues in the original study (-1: losses, +1: gains, 0: not highlighted by Chen et al.)
